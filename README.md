## What I Build

I design and deploy **production-grade AI agents** that transform how businesses operate. My focus is on **voice AI agents**, **agentic applications**, **Agent SDKs**, and **conversational AI systems** that actually ship and handle real-world complexity.

With **15+ years in web development** and the last **3 years specializing in voice & agentic AI**, I create solutions that go beyond demos—deployed systems processing real customer interactions at scale.

### Core Specialties

- **Voice AI Agents**: Production systems for claim processing, customer support automation, and voice-first interactions
- **Agentic Applications**: AI-driven workflows that autonomously handle complex multi-step operations
- **Agent SDKs**: Developer-friendly frameworks and tools for building different kinds of intelligent agents
- **Conversational AI**: End-to-end systems that understand context, handle nuance, and deliver seamless UX
- **LLM Optimization**: Fine-tuning, RAG strategies, and performance improvements for production AI systems
- **High-Performance Web Apps**: Scalable solutions built on 15+ years of web development expertise

## Current Focus

Building at the intersection of **voice technology**, **agentic AI**, and **enterprise automation**:

- 🎯 Voice AI agents for claims automation & intelligent customer support
- 🤖 Agentic applications that transform manual workflows into autonomous systems
- 🛠️ Agent SDKs & frameworks for building different types of agent experiences
- 🔊 Voice-first user interactions that feel natural & intuitive
- ⚡ AI-driven optimization for complex business processes
- 🚀 Production-grade integrations that scale
