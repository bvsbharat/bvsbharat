# 👋 Hi, I'm Bharat Satya

I build production-ready voice AI agents and agentic applications that are transforming how insurance companies handle claims and customer interactions.

With 15+ years in web development and the last 3 years specializing in conversational/voice AI agents and Agentic App's, I create solutions that actually work—not just demos, but deployed systems processing real claims and handling live customer conversations in the insurance domain.

## 🚀 What I Build

- **Voice AI Agents**: Production systems for automated claim processing and intelligent customer support
- **Agentic Applications**: AI-driven apps that autonomously handle complex insurance workflows
- **Agent SDKs**: Developer tools and frameworks for building different kinds of web and agent experiences
- **Conversational AI Systems**: End-to-end solutions that streamline traditional insurance operations
- **High-Performance Web Apps**: Scalable solutions built on 15 years of web development expertise

## 💡 Current Focus
