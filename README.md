# 👋 Hi, I'm Bharat Satya

I build production-ready voice AI agents and agentic applications that are transforming how insurance companies handle claims and customer interactions.

With 15+ years in web development and the last 3 years specializing in conversational/voice AI agents and Agent SDKs, I create solutions that actually work—not just demos, but deployed systems processing real claims and handling live customer conversations in the insurance domain.

## What I Work On

**Voice AI Agents & Agentic Applications**: Production systems for automated claim processing, intelligent customer support, and autonomous insurance workflows • **Agent SDKs & Frameworks**: Developer tools for building different kinds of web and agent-powered experiences • **Conversational AI Systems**: End-to-end voice-first solutions that streamline traditional insurance operations • **High-Performance Web Apps**: Scalable, AI-driven applications built on 15 years of web development expertise and battle-tested in real business operations.

## Current Focus

I'm deep in the intersection of voice technology, agentic AI, and insurance innovation—building systems that handle the complexity of real-world insurance workflows while delivering seamless user experiences. My work focuses on:

- Conversational and voice AI agents for claims automation
- Agentic applications that transform web experiences
- Agent SDKs for different types of intelligent interactions
- Voice-first customer interaction systems
- AI-driven workflow optimization in insurance
- Production-grade integrations that insurance teams actually use
